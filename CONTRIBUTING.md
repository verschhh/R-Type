## Setting Up the project locally


1.  [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone
    your fork:

    ```sh
    # Clone your fork
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/R-type.git

    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd R-type
    ```

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```sh
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/verschhh/R-type.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.
